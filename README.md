# Deep Lightning [![Python 3.8.8](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.8.8-blue)](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-388/)

### Here you will find

This project presents a neural network architecture based on cGANs (Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks), which seeks to approximate the indirect illumination of a variety of scenes. It's developed using [Pytorch Lightning](https://www.pytorchlightning.ai/).

This work is based on the project [Deep Illumination](https://github.com/CreativeCodingLab/DeepIllumination).
### Installation

To install dependencies run `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Usage

To view logs run `tensorboard --logdir lightning_logs`

### Datasets

The different datasets were created using [Radiance](https://www.radiance-online.org/). Scripts can be found [here](https://github.com/proyecto-grado/dataset-generator).
